# Fraction Calculator Project

Author: Princess Alexander

## Resources Used:
- java.math.BigInteger: Used for precise arithmetic operations on large numbers.
- java.util.Scanner: Used for reading input in the InteractiveCalculator.

I used the Java libraries we learned about in class for more information about these

I consulted readings, looked at MP1 for formatting and styling and asked questions at mentor session as well.

## About the Project:

This project provides a Java-based calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations on fractions and whole numbers. It includes both an interactive calculator mode.

### Main Classes:

- **BigFraction**: Represents fractions with precise numerators and denominators using BigInteger.
- **BFCalculator**: A calculator that performs arithmetic operations on BigFraction objects and stores the last result.
- **BFRegisterSet**: Stores fractions in registers identified by the letters 'a' through 'z'.
- **InteractiveCalculator**: Allows users to perform calculations interactively via the command-line.
- **QuickCalculator**: Processes multiple arithmetic expressions passed as command-line arguments and evaluates them in batch mode.

## Usage:

The project handles various errors such as invalid input or malformed expressions and provides clear error messages for user guidance.
